## Detailed Rule Explanations

### Profit Target
This is the primary objective of the evaluation. You must reach this target to pass the phase. For two-phase challenges, you must meet the target for each phase consecutively.

### Maximum Daily Loss
This rule is crucial for risk management. Your account equity (including floating positions) cannot fall below this limit within a 24-hour period, starting at 00:00 server time.

- **Calculation:** `(Starting Balance of the Day) - (5% of Initial Balance)`
- **Example:** On a $100K account, your daily loss limit is $5,000. If you start the day with $102K, your equity cannot drop below $97K.

### Maximum Overall Loss
This is the absolute floor for your account equity. It is a fixed amount based on your initial balance and does not trail your profits.

- **Calculation:** `(Initial Balance) - (10% of Initial Balance)`
- **Example:** On a $100K account, your equity can never drop below $90,000.

### Minimum Trading Days
This rule ensures that your performance is consistent over time, not the result of a single lucky trade. A trading day is counted if you open at least one position on that day.

### No Time Limits
We believe traders perform best without pressure. Take as much time as you need to pass the evaluation, as long as you do not violate any of the loss limits.

## Prohibited Trading Strategies

To maintain a fair and realistic trading environment, the following are strictly forbidden:

- **Martingale & Grid Trading:** We do not allow strategies that rely on increasing position size after losses.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):** This includes tick scalping and arbitrage strategies.
- **Group Trading / Account Copying:** Your trading activity must be your own. Copying trades from other accounts or trading as a group is not permitted.
- **Exploiting Demo Feeds:** Any attempt to exploit unrealistic price feeds or execution in the demo environment will lead to disqualification.
