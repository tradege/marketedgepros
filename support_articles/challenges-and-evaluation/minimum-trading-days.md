---

To successfully pass an evaluation phase, you must trade for a minimum number of days. This rule is in place to ensure your profitability is the result of a consistent strategy, not just a single lucky trade.

## The Rule: 5-10 Minimum Trading Days

- **Two-Phase Challenges:** Typically require a minimum of **5 trading days** per phase.
- **One-Phase Challenges:** Typically require a minimum of **10 trading days**.

There is no minimum trading day requirement for funded accounts.

## What Counts as a Trading Day?

A trading day is counted if you **open at least one new position** on that day. 

- The day is based on the server time (EET/EEST).
- Simply holding a position that was opened on a previous day does not count as a new trading day.

### Example:

- **Monday:** You open a trade on EUR/USD. (1 trading day)
- **Tuesday:** You do not open any new trades, but your EUR/USD trade is still open. (0 trading days for Tuesday)
- **Wednesday:** You close the EUR/USD trade and open a new trade on GBP/USD. (1 trading day for Wednesday)

**Total Trading Days:** 2

## No Pressure - No Time Limits

While there is a minimum number of days you must trade, there is **no maximum time limit** to complete the challenge. You can take as much time as you need to meet the profit target and the minimum trading day requirement.

> **Strategy Tip:** Don't force trades just to meet the minimum day requirement. Focus on taking high-quality setups according to your plan. If you reach your profit target early, you can simply place very small (micro-lot) trades for the remaining days to meet the requirement without taking on significant risk.
