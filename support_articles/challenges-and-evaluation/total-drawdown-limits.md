# Total Drawdown Limits Explained

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

The Maximum Overall Loss (or Total Drawdown) is the absolute floor for your account. This article explains how this crucial rule works.

## The Rule: 10-12% Maximum Overall Loss

Your account equity can never, at any point, drop below a certain percentage of your initial account balance. This limit is typically 10% or 12%, depending on the challenge type.

## How It's Calculated

The Maximum Overall Loss is a fixed amount and **does not trail** your profits. It is calculated once at the start of your challenge and remains the same throughout.

**Formula:**
`Max Overall Loss Limit = (Initial Account Balance) - (Percentage * Initial Account Balance)`

### Example:

- **Account Size:** $100,000
- **Max Overall Loss:** 10% ($10,000)

Your overall loss limit is **$90,000** (`$100,000 - $10,000`).

This means your account equity, including all closed and open positions, can never fall below $90,000. If it does, the account is violated.

## Key Differences: Daily vs. Overall Loss

It is important to understand the difference between the two loss limits:

| Feature | Daily Loss | Overall Loss |
|---|---|---|
| **Calculation Basis** | Balance at start of day | Initial account balance |
| **Resets?** | Yes, every day | No, it is fixed |
| **Purpose** | Prevents large single-day losses | Protects overall company capital |

## How to Monitor Your Overall Drawdown

Your MarketEdgePros dashboard shows your Maximum Overall Loss limit clearly. You can see exactly how much of a buffer you have before you would violate this rule.

> **Strategy Tip:** Because the overall loss limit does not trail, as you make profits, your buffer increases. For example, if you make $5,000 on a $100K account, your equity is $105,000. You now have a $15,000 buffer before hitting the $90,000 limit ($105,000 - $90,000).
