Passing a prop firm challenge requires a combination of skill, discipline, and strategy. Here are our top recommendations for successfully completing your MarketEdgePros evaluation.

## 1. Understand the Rules Inside and Out

Before you place your first trade, make sure you have a deep understanding of all the trading rules, especially the loss limits.

Knowing your limits will prevent you from accidentally violating a rule.

## 2. Have a Solid Trading Plan

Don't just jump into the market. A trading plan is your roadmap to success. It should include:

- **Your Strategy:** What are your entry and exit criteria?
- **Risk Management:** How much will you risk per trade? (We recommend 1-2% of your account).
- **Trading Schedule:** When will you trade? (Avoid trading when you are tired or emotional).
- **Asset Selection:** Which currency pairs or instruments will you focus on?

## 3. Focus on Consistency, Not Speed

There are **no time limits** on our challenges. This is a significant advantage. Use it wisely.

- **Don't rush:** There is no need to reach the profit target in a few days.
- **Take high-probability setups:** Be selective and wait for trades that match your plan.
- **Focus on the process:** If you follow your plan and manage risk, the profits will come.

## 4. Manage Your Risk Carefully

Risk management is the single most important factor in passing a challenge.

- **Respect the Daily Loss Limit:** Always know how much you can lose in a day and stop trading if you get close to the limit.
- **Use Stop Losses:** Every trade should have a stop loss to protect your capital.
- **Calculate Your Position Size:** Use a position size calculator to ensure you are not risking too much on a single trade.

> **Pro Tip:** Many traders aim for a risk-to-reward ratio of at least 1:2. This means for every $1 you risk, you aim to make $2 in profit.

## 5. Review Your Trades

Keep a trading journal to track your performance. At the end of each day or week, review your trades:

- **What did you do well?**
- **What mistakes did you make?**
- **Did you follow your trading plan?**

This process of self-evaluation is critical for improvement.
