This guide will walk you through the process of installing MetaTrader 5 (MT5), the powerful platform you'll use to trade with MarketEdgePros.

## Step 1: Download the MT5 Installer

First, you need to download the correct installer for your operating system from the official MetaQuotes website.

- [Download for Windows](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download)
- [Download for macOS](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download)
- [Download for Linux](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download)


## Step 2: Run the Installer

Once the download is complete, locate the file and run it.

- **On Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file. Follow the on-screen prompts, accepting the license agreement.
- **On macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file and drag the MetaTrader 5 application into your Applications folder.


## Step 3: Open MT5 and Find Our Server

Launch the MT5 application. When you open it for the first time, it may prompt you to open an account. You can close this window.

1. Go to **File > Open an Account**.
2. In the search box, type **"MarketEdgePros"** and click **"Find your company"**.
3. Select the appropriate server from the list (e.g., `MarketEdgePros-Demo` or `MarketEdgePros-Live`).
4. Click **"Next"**.


## Step 4: Log In to Your Trading Account

1. Select **"Connect with an existing trade account"**.
2. Enter the **Login** (Account Number) and **Password** that were emailed to you.
3. Ensure you have selected the correct server.
4. Click **"Finish"**.

If your login is successful, you will hear a confirmation chime and see your account details appear in the "Trade" tab of the Terminal window.


## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid Account" error:** This usually means the login, password, or server is incorrect. Double-check the credentials you received via email. Passwords are case-sensitive.
- **"No Connection" error:** Check your internet connection. Also, ensure you have selected the correct server name.
