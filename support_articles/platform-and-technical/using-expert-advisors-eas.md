# Using Expert Advisors (EAs)

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

---

MarketEdgePros allows the use of Expert Advisors (EAs), also known as trading robots. However, their use is subject to certain conditions to ensure fair and responsible trading.

## Permitted Use of EAs

You are welcome to use EAs that:

- **Assist your trading:** EAs that help with calculations, risk management, or trade execution based on your strategy.
- **Automate your own strategy:** If you have developed your own EA that executes your unique trading strategy, it is generally permitted.


## Prohibited Use of EAs

The following types of EAs are strictly prohibited and will result in account termination:

1.  **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) EAs:** EAs that perform tick scalping or latency arbitrage.
2.  **Martingale or Grid EAs:** Any EA that uses a martingale or grid-based strategy of increasing lot sizes after losses.
3.  **Group Trading EAs:** EAs that are used by a large group of traders to execute the exact same strategy, effectively acting as a single entity.
4.  **Third-Party EAs:** You may not use a commercially available, off-the-shelf EA that is widely used by many other traders. Your strategy must be unique to you.


## The "Unique Strategy" Rule

The core principle is that your trading account must be traded independently. If your EA is executing the same trades as a large number of other accounts at the same time, it will be flagged as group trading and a violation of our terms.

> **Our Goal:** We are looking to fund individual, talented traders, not to back large-scale automated strategies that are not unique.


## Getting Your EA Approved

If you are unsure whether your EA is permitted, we strongly encourage you to contact our support team **before** using it on your challenge or funded account. We can review the strategy and provide guidance.
