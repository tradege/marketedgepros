## Our Philosophy: Simple & Fair Rules

At MarketEdgePros, we believe in keeping things simple. Our trading rules are designed to be clear, fair, and easy to follow. They are in place to help you manage risk and develop consistent trading habits.

Here is a breakdown of our most important rules.

---

## 1. Profit Target

- **What it is:** The minimum profit you must achieve to pass an evaluation phase.
- **Typical Target:** 8-10% for evaluation phases.
- **Funded Accounts:** There is no profit target on funded accounts. You can trade and withdraw profits as you make them.

---

## 2. Maximum Daily Loss

- **What it is:** The maximum amount your account can lose in a single day.
- **Typical Limit:** 5% of your initial account balance.
- **How it's calculated:** The daily loss is calculated based on your balance at the start of the day (00:00 server time). It includes both closed and open positions (floating losses).
- **Example:** On a $100,000 account, the max daily loss is $5,000. If your account balance at the start of the day is $102,000, your account cannot drop below $97,000 on that day.

> **Important:** If you violate the daily loss limit, your account will be automatically closed.

## 3. Maximum Overall Loss

- **What it is:** The maximum total drawdown your account can have at any time.
- **Typical Limit:** 10-12% of your initial account balance.
- **How it's calculated:** The max overall loss is a fixed amount based on your initial balance. It does not trail with your profits.
- **Example:** On a $100,000 account with a 10% max loss, your account equity can never drop below $90,000.

---

## 4. Minimum Trading Days

- **What it is:** The minimum number of days you need to place at least one trade to pass an evaluation.
- **Typical Requirement:** 5-10 days.
- **Why we have it:** This rule is in place to ensure you are not just getting lucky with a single trade. We want to see consistent trading over a period of time.

## 5. Prohibited Strategies

To ensure fair play and responsible risk management, the following strategies are **not allowed**:

- **Martingale/Grid Trading:** Increasing your position size after a loss.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):** Using automated systems to place a very large number of trades in a short time.
- **Account Copying:** Copying trades between multiple accounts.
- **Exploiting Demo Environments:** Taking advantage of unrealistic fills or price feeds in the demo environment.

Violation of these rules will result in account closure.
