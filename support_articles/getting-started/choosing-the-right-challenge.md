## 2. Select Your Account Size

We offer a wide range of account sizes, from **$10,000 to $400,000**. 

When choosing your account size, consider the following:

- **Your Experience Level:** If you are new to prop trading, it may be wise to start with a smaller account ($10K or $25K) to get comfortable with our rules.
- **Your Trading Strategy:** Does your strategy require a larger account to manage risk effectively?
- **The Cost:** Larger accounts have a higher one-time fee.

> **Remember:** You can always scale your account later! Consistent, profitable traders are eligible for account scaling up to $400,000.

## 3. Review the Trading Rules

All our challenges share a common set of simple, transparent rules. Before you start, make sure you understand:

- **Profit Target:** The percentage of profit you need to make.
- **Max Daily Loss:** The maximum amount you can lose in a single day (usually 5%).
- **Max Overall Loss:** The maximum total drawdown your account can have (usually 10-12%).
- **Minimum Trading Days:** The minimum number of days you need to trade (usually 5-10 days).
- **Prohibited Strategies:** We do not allow high-risk strategies like martingale or grid trading.
