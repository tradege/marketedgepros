# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a critical layer of security to your MarketEdgePros account. We highly recommend that all users enable it.

## What is 2FA?

2FA requires you to provide two pieces of information to log in:

1.  **Something you know:** Your password.
2.  **Something you have:** A one-time code generated by an app on your phone.

This means that even if someone steals your password, they will not be able to access your account without physical access to your phone.


## How to Enable 2FA

1.  **Log in** to your MarketEdgePros dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **"Security"** section.
3.  Click on **"Enable Two-Factor Authentication"**.
4.  **Download an Authenticator App:** If you don't already have one, download an app like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator on your smartphone.
5.  **Scan the QR Code:** Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code displayed on your dashboard.
6.  **Enter the Code:** Your app will generate a 6-digit code. Enter this code on the dashboard to confirm.
7.  **Save Your Backup Codes:** You will be given a set of backup codes. **Save these in a safe place.** If you lose your phone, you will need these codes to access your account.


## How to Use 2FA

Once enabled, every time you log in to your dashboard, you will be asked to enter your password and the 6-digit code from your authenticator app.


## Disabling 2FA

You can disable 2FA from the same "Security" section of your dashboard. You will need to enter a code from your authenticator app to confirm.


## Lost Your Phone?

If you have lost access to your authenticator app, you can use one of your backup codes to log in. Once you are in, you should disable 2FA and then re-enable it with your new device.

If you have lost both your phone and your backup codes, you will need to contact support to go through a manual identity verification process.
