**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

Protecting your trading account is a shared responsibility. While MarketEdgePros uses state-of-the-art security to protect our systems, there are several steps you should take to secure your account.

## 1. Use a Strong, Unique Password

- Your password should be at least 12 characters long.
- Use a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Do not** reuse passwords from other websites.
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your online accounts.


## 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

This is the single most effective step you can take to secure your account. 2FA prevents unauthorized access even if your password is stolen.

## 3. Beware of Phishing Scams

Phishing is when attackers try to trick you into giving them your login details.

- **Be suspicious of unsolicited emails:** MarketEdgePros will never email you asking for your password.
- **Check the sender's email address:** Ensure it is from our official domain (`@marketedgepros.com`).
- **Do not click on suspicious links:** If you are unsure, type our website address directly into your browser instead of clicking a link.
- **Look for the padlock:** Always ensure you are on our official website with a valid SSL certificate (https://) before entering your login details.


## 4. Secure Your Computer and Network

- **Keep your operating system and browser updated.**
- **Use a reputable antivirus and anti-malware program.**
- **Avoid using public Wi-Fi** for trading or accessing your account. If you must, use a trusted VPN.


## 5. Be Careful on Social Media

- **Do not share sensitive information** about your account or trading performance publicly.
- **Beware of impersonators:** Scammers may create fake profiles pretending to be MarketEdgePros staff or successful traders. Our staff will never contact you via social media to ask for account details or money.


## What to Do If You Suspect Your Account is Compromised

1.  Immediately **change your password** for both your dashboard and your MT5 account.
2.  **Contact our support team** right away.
3.  Review your account activity for any unauthorized trades.
