To comply with international financial regulations and ensure the security of our platform, MarketEdgePros requires all funded traders to complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process.

## Why is KYC Required?

KYC is a standard procedure in the financial industry to:

- **Prevent Fraud:** Verify the identity of our traders.
- **Combat Money Laundering:** Ensure that our platform is not used for illegal activities.
- **Protect Your Account:** Add an extra layer of security to your account.


## When is KYC Required?

You will be asked to complete KYC verification **after you pass your challenge** and before you receive your first funded account.


## What Documents are Needed?

You will need to provide two types of documents:

### 1. Proof of Identity (one of the following):
- **Passport:** A clear, color copy of your passport photo page.
- **Driver's License:** A clear, color copy of the front and back.
- **National ID Card:** A clear, color copy of the front and back.

*The document must be valid (not expired) and clearly show your photo, full name, and date of birth.*

### 2. Proof of Address (one of the following):
- **Utility Bill:** (e.g., electricity, water, gas, internet) - must be dated within the last 3 months.
- **Bank Statement:** Must be dated within the last 3 months.
- **Credit Card Statement:** Must be dated within the last 3 months.

*The document must clearly show your full name and current residential address.*


## How to Submit Your Documents
