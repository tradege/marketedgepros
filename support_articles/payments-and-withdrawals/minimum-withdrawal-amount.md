# Minimum Withdrawal Amount

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

---

To provide our traders with maximum flexibility, we have a very low minimum withdrawal amount.

## The Rule: $50 Minimum Withdrawal

The minimum amount of profit you can withdraw from your funded account is **$50**.

This applies to all withdrawal methods, including bank transfer, cryptocurrency, and PayPal.

## Why We Have This Rule

While we want to be as flexible as possible, processing payments involves transaction fees (e.g., bank fees or crypto network fees). A minimum withdrawal amount ensures that these fees do not consume a significant portion of your payout.

### No Maximum Limit

There is **no maximum limit** on the amount you can withdraw. You are free to withdraw all of your profits at any time (as long as the amount is over $50).
