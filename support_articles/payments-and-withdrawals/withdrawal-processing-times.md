### Factors That Can Cause Delays

While we always process requests within 24 hours, some external factors can cause delays:

- **Bank Holidays:** International and local bank holidays can delay bank transfers.
- **Incorrect Information:** If you provide incorrect payout details (e.g., wrong bank account number or crypto address), the payment will fail and need to be re-processed.
- **First-Time Withdrawal:** Your first withdrawal may take slightly longer as we conduct a final review of your account and trading history.

> **Note:** We will send you an email confirmation as soon as we have processed your withdrawal request from our end.
