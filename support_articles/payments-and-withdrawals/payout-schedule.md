Our payout schedule is designed to be flexible and trader-friendly. We want you to have access to your profits when you need them.

## On-Demand Payouts

After your first withdrawal, MarketEdgePros operates on an **on-demand** payout schedule. This means you can request a withdrawal at any time, as often as you like, as long as you have profits in your account.

## Your First Payout

There is a special condition for your very first payout:

- You are eligible to request your first payout **30 calendar days** after you place your first trade on your live funded account.

This initial period allows us to establish a baseline of your trading performance on a live account.

## After the First Payout

Once your first payout has been processed, you are free to request subsequent payouts:

- **Anytime:** Request a payout on any day of the week.
- **Any Amount:** As long as it is over the $50 minimum.
- **As Often as You Like:** You can request a payout daily, weekly, or monthly – it's completely up to you.
