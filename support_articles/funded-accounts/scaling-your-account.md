# Scaling Your Account

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

---

Our Scaling Plan is designed to reward consistent, profitable traders by increasing both their account size and profit split. This is our way of investing in our best talent.

## The Goal: Trade up to $400,000

Our ultimate goal is to have our traders manage a **$400,000** account with a **90% profit split**.

## How the Scaling Plan Works

Every three months, we will review your account performance. If you meet the eligibility criteria, we will increase your account balance by **25%** of its original size.

### Eligibility Criteria:

1.  **Profitability:** You must be profitable in at least 2 out of the last 3 months.
2.  **Total Profit:** You must have generated a total profit of at least **10%** over the 3-month period.
3.  **Risk Management:** You must have consistently followed all trading rules.

### Example:

- **You start with a $100,000 account.**
- **After 3 months, you have made a 12% profit.**
- We will increase your account balance to **$125,000**.
- After another 3 months of consistent profits, we will increase it to **$150,000**, and so on.

This process continues until you reach the maximum account size of $400,000.

## 90% Profit Split

Once your account has been scaled for the first time, your profit split will automatically be increased to **90%** for all future withdrawals.

## Important Notes

- **Review is Automatic:** You do not need to apply for the Scaling Plan. Our team will automatically review all eligible accounts every quarter.
- **Drawdown Limits Adjust:** When your account is scaled, your drawdown limits will be adjusted based on the new, larger account balance.
