# Profit Split Explained

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

At MarketEdgePros, we believe our traders deserve to keep the majority of the profits they generate. Our profit split model is one of the most generous in the industry.

## The Rule: Up to 90% Profit Split

- **Standard Profit Split:** 80%
- **With Scaling Plan:** Can increase to 90%

This means that you, the trader, will receive **80-90%** of all profits you make on your funded account. We, the firm, retain 10-20%.

## How It Works

When you request a withdrawal, we will calculate the total profit in your account. We will then transfer your share of the profits to your chosen payment method.

### Example:

- **Account Size:** $100,000
- **Profit Made:** $10,000
- **Profit Split:** 80%

- **Your Share (80%):** $8,000
- **Firm's Share (20%):** $2,000

You will receive a payout of **$8,000**.

## Increasing Your Profit Split to 90%

Consistent and profitable traders are eligible for our Scaling Plan. As you grow your account, your profit split can also increase.

- **Eligibility:** To be eligible for the Scaling Plan, you must be profitable for at least 3 consecutive months and meet certain performance criteria.
- **Benefit:** Once you are on the Scaling Plan, your profit split will be increased to **90%**.

For more details, please see our **[Scaling Your Account](/support/scaling-your-account)** page.

## No Hidden Fees

We believe in transparency. The profit split is straightforward. There are no other hidden fees or charges on your profits.

> **Note:** Depending on your chosen withdrawal method, there may be transaction fees from the payment processor (e.g., bank wire fees or crypto network fees). These are not fees from MarketEdgePros.
