# Account Consistency Requirements

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

---

At MarketEdgePros, we encourage traders to build sustainable, long-term trading habits. While we do not have a strict "consistency rule" like some other firms, we do monitor trading activity to ensure responsible and realistic trading practices.

## Our Philosophy

We want our traders to succeed in the long run. This means we discourage high-risk, "all-or-nothing" trading styles. Our goal is to partner with traders who can generate consistent profits while managing risk effectively.

## What We Look For

During our account reviews (especially for the Scaling Plan), we look for signs of consistent and disciplined trading. This includes:

- **Consistent Position Sizing:** Your trade sizes should be relatively consistent and in proportion to your account size. We don't want to see one massive trade that accounts for all your profit.
- **Regular Trading Activity:** We look for traders who are active in the market, not just placing one or two trades a month.
- **Adherence to a Strategy:** Your trading should show a clear, repeatable strategy, not random gambling.

## What to Avoid

While not strictly prohibited (unless they violate other rules), we discourage the following:

- **Single Large Trades:** Relying on one or two huge trades to meet the profit target.
- **Holding a Single Trade for the Entire Period:** We want to see active management of your portfolio.
- **Drastic Changes in Trading Style:** Suddenly switching from a conservative to a hyper-aggressive approach.

## No Penalties, Just Guidance

If we notice inconsistent trading, we will not penalize you or close your account (as long as no other rules are broken). Instead, our team may reach out to you to offer guidance and support to help you develop more consistent habits.

Our aim is to help you become a better trader.
