# Trading on a Funded Account

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

---

Trading on a funded account is different from the evaluation phase. The pressure of passing is gone, and your focus now shifts to generating consistent profits. Here are some key things to keep in mind.

## 1. No More Profit Targets

Once you are funded, there are **no more profit targets**. You can trade at your own pace and withdraw your profits as you make them. Your main objective is to stay within the loss limits.

---

## 2. Loss Limits Still Apply

The Maximum Daily Loss and Maximum Overall Loss rules are still in effect. These are calculated based on your initial funded account balance.

- **Max Daily Loss:** 5%
- **Max Overall Loss:** 10-12%

It is crucial that you continue to practice disciplined risk management to protect your funded account.

## 3. Consistency is Key

We are looking for traders who can generate consistent profits over the long term. Avoid taking excessive risks or changing your strategy dramatically.

- **Stick to your trading plan:** The strategy that got you funded is likely a good one. Continue to follow it.
- **Focus on steady growth:** Aim for steady, consistent gains rather than trying to hit home runs.

## 4. Payouts and Withdrawals

You are eligible for your first payout 30 days after placing your first trade on the funded account. After that, you can request payouts on-demand.
